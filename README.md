Yo o/
as a yound starting coder, I'm trying to do as much projects as possible because I love learning ! 
my main project rn is about Hypixel Skyblock on minecraft, a mode I love to play.
All here is only for fun and learning experience, for any suggestion or advices, add me on Discord ; "n3li0"
ofc, I'm helped my AI for my first steps, but i mainly do by myself the code. 
peace
